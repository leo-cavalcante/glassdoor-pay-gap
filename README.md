## Project Description
Individual project developed in an afternoon, using a Glassdoor database found in Kaggle website.

## Objectives
The project had **2 distinct objectives**:
1. Derive **statistically significant insights** from a database.
2. Model a **regression analysis** for a variable (in this project, we have chosen to do use the linear regression to predict the probability of a crime to happen in a given date with some given circunstances.)

## Workflow
1. **Database search and download**, finally deciding on a open source database found in [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/nilimajauhari/glassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap).
2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**.
3. **Data Analysis & Visualisations**: Using `Python`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: to test statistically significant events.

Next steps to be developed:
1. **Linear Regression using OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: find a good variable to predict, maybe the salary.
2. **Assumptions testing**: verification of the assumptions for the OLS model.
3. **Presentation**: Google Slides construction.
